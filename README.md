# Endocarditis


A project for Jose's learning. Yay.

## How to:

In your console, while in `Endocarditis` directory
* `npm install`
* `mkdir data`
* Download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)
* Set up your path variable. Give me a call and I'll walk you through it.
* `npm run database`
* `npm start`

Now you'll have our server running and ready to serve data to our app!
